I am creating a clone of Nintendo's very popular 2D RPG Game Series using Unity Game Engine. 
I have tried to recreate the original game design and feel in my project as a big fan. 
As a developer I have implemented various design programming patterns in my code like Singleton, Observer Pattern, State Machine, etc to make my code architecture scalable and modular.

You can have a look at the current stage of the project here below:
